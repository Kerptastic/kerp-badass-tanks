Known Issues:

1.) Changed intro music to "warning" sound in order to cut down the filesize to submit.
2.) When game over reached either by dying or winning at the boss fight causes the game to lock up 
    by choosing New Game and Exit via 'N' or 'E' respectively.
3.) Full screen mode via F1 makes for some funny visuals. No explanation since we didnt have time to explore it.
4.) Maximizing the game window causes for the mouse movement to inaccurately aim the tank at certain resolutions.
